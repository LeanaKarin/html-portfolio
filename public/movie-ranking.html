 <h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
 <p>This is a mind-bending movie about two people who are in love with eachother but don't remember one-another.</p>
 <h3>True Romance</h3>
 <p>A Quintin Tarantino script directed by Tony Scott - when a kung-fu movie buff falls in love with a call girl on her first night on the job. Their romance is tested as they try to make money and run away from their past lives.</p>
 <h3>There Will be Blood</h3>
 <p>An Upton Sinclair book adaptation about an oil man and the life he builds around this world. The last 20 minutes of the movie has an epic monologue.</p>
